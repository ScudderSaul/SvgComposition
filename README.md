# SvgComposition
Svg Editor for Visual Studio

SvgComposition is a simple tool for textual SVG composition in Visual studio, 
It is not a graphics editor like Inkscape, just a text/script edit tool that works with SVG (SVG 2.0 was the plan). 
Scripts can be edited and then exported to '.svg' or '.html' files. 
The tool also has a button to open a browser window and display the script being edited.
